# Restaurant Seat Booking Application

Restaurants have been around for a while satisfying the hunger of people and the desire for good food around the world. The purpose of visiting a restaurant has ranged from trying new food to being one of the events for an outing. Such plans brought with them a huge crowd of people visiting restaurants on a daily basis. Situations started arising where there were no tables available at a restaurant and people had to wait in long queues before getting a chance to satisfy their hunger.

In the past few years, it is experienced that customers are desirous to find a handy application for reservation of tables and menus or any other services to avoid physically walking to the hotel or contacting by call or reserving through a middleman.
